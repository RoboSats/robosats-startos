# Welcome to RoboSats!
A simple and private Lightning P2P exchange you can use directly from StartOS.

You can find a quick start guide, tutorial videos, and detailed documentation at [Learn RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/).
## Basic Use
1. Open RoboSats by using the `LAUNCH UI` button.
2. For the first time using RoboSats, you will be provided a robot token (a unique, transient identifier) - you can create as many of these as you'd like. 
3. You can save this token on the RoboSats service config screen if you need to persist your session.

**Note: It is strongly recommended to use a new robot every time when using RoboSats.**
