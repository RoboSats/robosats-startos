# Welcome to RoboSats!
A simple and private Lightning P2P exchange you can use directly from StartOS.

You can find a quick start guide, tutorial videos, and detailed documentation at [Learn RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/).
## Basic Use
1. Open RoboSats by using the `LAUNCH UI` button.

2. For the first time using RoboSats, you will be provided a robot token (a unique, transient identifier) - you can create as many of these as you'd like.

    **IMPORTANT: Robots are saved in your "Garage."  It is strongly recommended to use a new robot every time you start a new exchange!  Please be aware that your Robot Garage will be different on the Tor (`.onion`) and LAN (`.local`) interfaces.  Be sure to follow your trade to completion on the same interface, as it will not be synced between the two.**
