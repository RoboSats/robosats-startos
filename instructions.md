# Welcome to RoboSats!
A simple and private Lightning P2P exchange you can use directly from StartOS.

You can find a quick start guide, tutorial videos, and detailed documentation at [Learn RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/).
## Basic Use
1. Open RoboSats by using the `LAUNCH UI` button.
2. For the first time using RoboSats, you will be provided a robot token (a unique, transient identifier) - you can create as many of these as you'd like.

**Note: Robots are saved in your "garage."  It is strongly recommended to use a new robot every time you start a new exchange.**
